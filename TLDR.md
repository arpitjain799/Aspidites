The reference implementation of the [Woma programming language](https://www.github.com/rjdbcm/woma) compiler. There is also a genus of Python called _Aspidites_, latin for shield-bearer, that is this project's namesake. We maintain several packages for Aspidites, however, we *recommend* using the PyPI install for the latest stable version. Docker is the place to go for the bleeding edge development versions of Aspidites.
# Running 
```shell
$ docker run -v $PWD:/workdir rjdbcm/aspidites:latest -h
```
